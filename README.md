Abstract—As the number of people living in Boston grows, the traffic environment has be- come more and more crowded. In recent years, local government has already built up the bicycle system to ameliorate traffic conditions and create a green environment. The idea is to design and implement a bicycle system that is accessible and convenient to the public by planning station locations satisfying the public needs. Citizens can rent a bike from one station and return it at another bike station close to their destinations. However, it is important and challenging for the government to arrange bicycle stations appropriately so that the system can benefit almost everyone and balance traffic flows in Boston as much as possible. Our approach is to arrange bicycle station locations such that maximizes the coverage of the bicycle system and increase penetration of bicycle usage, based on the hubway bike data in Boston between 2011 and 2013. Furthermore, since data of capacity of hubway locations in Boston area is unavailable, we will estimate it with historical data, which contains information on stations and every trip. Our goal is to find the best locations to mitigate traffic problems and create a green environment in Boston Area.
